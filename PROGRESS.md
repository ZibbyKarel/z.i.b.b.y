# ZIBBY — Loop Progress

> Phased self-development on the current branch. One loop iteration = one phase
> slice, design → implement → verify → checkpoint → record. Full roadmap:
> [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md); per-phase plans in [docs/plans/](docs/plans/).

## Phase 12: self-development safety — ✅ COMPLETE (2026-06-14)

Make ZIBBY a safe target for its own loop engine (the "MEMORY BOMB" RCA).
**All items 12.1–12.9 done; full suite 672/672 green.** ZIBBY may now be pointed at
its own repo under the [self-development runbook](docs/ops/self-development.md).
Detailed plan + verified RCA: [docs/plans/phase-12.md](docs/plans/phase-12.md).

| Item | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| 12.5 Global e2e data-dir + runner-mode isolation | ✅ done (2026-06-14) | temp `ZIBBY_DATA_DIR` (seeded, volatile filtered) + `AGENT_RUNNER_MODE=demo` + fake `CLAUDE_BIN` in `vitest.setup.ts`; `data-dir.ts` VITEST tripwire. Full `pnpm test` no longer touches `apps/api/data` or spawns real claude. 643/643 api tests green. |
| 12.1 Scope/forbid heavy default verifier | ✅ done (2026-06-14) | goal `checks` verifier with no commands + no project checks parks `verifier-scope`, never runs full-repo `DEFAULT_VERIFY_CHECKS` |
| 12.2 Never run checks from inside the repo | ✅ done (2026-06-14) | verifier `spawnCwd` never falls back to `run.cwd`; no worktree/project → park `verifier-scope`. Pure `checksVerifierBlocker` + `drive()` pre-flight park + `runVerifier` floor |
| 12.3 Resource governance in `runShell` + shutdown hook | ✅ done (2026-06-14) | detached pgid spawn + wall-clock timeout (SIGTERM→SIGKILL) + `liveShells` tracking + `onModuleDestroy` reaping + output cap; `main.ts` now `enableShutdownHooks()` so reapers fire on SIGTERM |
| 12.4 Gate `reconstruct()` re-dispatch (Law 3) | ✅ done (2026-06-14) | rehydrate always; boot parks live goals `awaiting-resume` (no auto-dispatch) unless `GOAL_AUTO_RESUME=1`; all `drive()` sites `.catch(onDriveError)` |
| 12.6 Eliminate double verification | ✅ done (2026-06-14) | `PipelineRun.verifyCommands` marker (runner-set from real execution); goal `makerAlreadyVerified()` skips `runVerifier` only when resolved commands provably equal. 669/669 api green |
| 12.7 Worktrees outside the repo | ✅ done (2026-06-14) | shared `worktree-root.ts` (not from data root); all 3 runners cut worktrees in `ZIBBY_WORKTREE_ROOT`/`os.tmpdir()`. Does NOT fix the `ENOTEMPTY` flake (that's the RunnerCore shutdown-await race → 12.9) |
| 12.9 Synchronous reaping on shutdown | ✅ done (2026-06-14) | `RunnerCore.shutdown()` async, awaits child exit + log flush (SIGTERM→SIGKILL); e2e cleanups use `fs.rm` `maxRetries/retryDelay` (the real flake fix). `ENOTEMPTY` gone across 6 runs; suite hit 660/660 |
| 12.8 Durable self-development posture | ✅ done (2026-06-14) | `docs/ops/self-development.md` runbook (builder ≠ subject, OS sandbox, defense-in-depth, resource-gov-as-contract) + env knobs doc + guard test (subject worktree never under builder tree). **CLOSES PHASE 12** |

**Blast-radius prerequisite** (must be green before pointing the loop at this repo):
12.1–12.4 — ✅ **COMPLETE** (2026-06-14). 12.5 landed first as the safety foundation
(it protects every subsequent `pnpm test` from re-arming the bomb). Remaining 12.6–12.8
are waste/blast-radius reduction + durable posture, not prerequisites.

### Parked / known flakes

- ~~`pipelines.e2e`/`agent-runs.e2e` `ENOTEMPTY`~~ — **FIXED in 12.9** (e2e cleanups now
  use `fs.rm` `maxRetries/retryDelay` + shutdown awaits reaping). Gone across 6 runs.
- `pipelines.e2e` "seeded delivery pipeline > red verify loops back to koder, then
  finishes green" — intermittent demo-timeout assertion flake (the documented
  `project_api_flaky_pipeline_e2e`); passed 6/7 recent runs. Demo-runner timing, NOT a
  cleanup race. Separate from the ENOTEMPTY work.
- `categories.e2e` "rejects a duplicate" — flakes only under full-suite load; passes
  6/6 in isolation. Pre-existing under-load timing flake.

## Next iteration — Phase 12 is closed; propose Phase 13

**Phase 13 — self-development exit demonstration + spend governance (proposed).** Phase
12 made the repo *safe* to target; Phase 13 is the *payoff* — prove it end-to-end and
wire the one resource-governance piece 12.8 documented but didn't enforce:

- **13.1 Per-goal compute budget enforced (not just documented).** 12.8 named
  resource-governance as a contract dimension but the per-goal token/compute cap is still
  only the interim 12.3 timeout + 8.1 per-project budget. Add a `budget` ceiling on the
  goal itself (the `GoalSchema.budget` field exists — wire it into the iteration loop:
  over-cap → park `budget`, the existing reason). e2e: a goal with a tiny budget parks
  after N iterations. Reuses 8.1 `BudgetService` + the existing `decideStop` budget arm.
- **13.2 Self-development smoke (the Phase 12 exit demonstration).** A demo-mode e2e that
  registers a *sibling fixture checkout* as a project, points a goal (delivery-pipeline
  maker + scoped verifier) at it, runs to done, and asserts: the builder's own tree is
  untouched (git status clean on the runner repo), the worktree lived under
  `ZIBBY_WORKTREE_ROOT`, no full-repo suite ran, no orphan child. Codifies the Phase 12
  exit criterion as an executable test, not just a checklist.
- **13.3 (stretch) launchd daemon + `GOAL_AUTO_RESUME`** wiring (Phase 8.3 territory) so
  an unattended builder can resume across reboots — the only place auto-resume is
  legitimate.

Pick 13.1 first (smallest, enforces the last governance gap); 13.2 is the capstone demo.
Alternatively, if the operator wants to *actually* self-develop now, the
[runbook](docs/ops/self-development.md) is ready — that's an operator action, not a loop
iteration.
